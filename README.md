### FLEXBOX

In this mini project I tried to understand **flexbox** and its features better and deeper.

I used **flex order** to reorder elements in different viewpoints and also made the use of **flex-basis**, **flex-grow**, **flex-shrink** to adjust items in different screen widths. 

I have learned how to using **nested flexbox** to have more control on elements too.
